# Overview

This repository contains the work I did on a project focusing on the design and implementation of an Agent Based Model (ABM) to simulate ant behaviour.
This project was completed as part of a college module *’Building Complex Computational Models’*.

# File Description

My code for this creating this model was written in Python and is made up of four main files.
These are:
1.	*'ant_simulation_config.yaml'*
    – This file contains the parameters used to run the model which can easily be changed.

2.	*'ant_classes.py'*
    – This file contains the classes used in the simulation to define objects that occur.
    – These include an Ant, an AntHill, and a Trail.

3.	*'ant_simulation.py'*
    – This file defines the agent-based model and the logic used to simulate the ant environment.

4.	*'gui_class.py'*
    – This file contains the class needed to run the interactive GUI in this simulation.
    – This code was adapted using the code contained [here](https://github.com/hsayama/PyCX/blob/master/pycxsimulator.py) and was updated and built on for the purpose of this assignment.
